# Embedded-Systems-Assembly
Here i share some projects that i built in Assembly language using Atmel studio and PlatformIO for an embedded systems course that i took during my study for electrical engineeering.

# About my Board
My board is Atmega328pb with an extra board attached to it.\
The extra board has a tri-color LED on connected to the microcontroller,four 7 segment displays,\
three potentiometer that can be used to control light intencity, and three buttons.

Note that the figures above are from a handout that our proffisor gave to us,
for that reason i archeaved this repo becuase he does not want his work to be open source.
The code and the sulotions are all mine and anyone welcome to use them
